    "# Lab 5 - LiDAR\n",
    "In this lab you will focus on using LiDAR to look at earthquake-related displacements on faults in California. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of airborne LiDAR has been a boon for studies of fault geomorphology as applied to seismic hazard. Large and well-funded projects have led to the collection of high-resolution topographic data over many of the active faults in the United States and across the globe. The ability to measure returns from the ground, rather than the tops of trees or bushes, is especially useful in vegetated areas. Due to the open data policy of funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (which funded a lot of the data collection efforts), we can access the full resolution data ourselves, from the __[OpenTopography online portal](https://opentopography.org/)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit will have two elements. First, we will briefly learn to interpret geomorphic features associated with strike-slip faulting and use the different scales and ages of offset features on one part of the San Andreas Fault to estimate both a slip rate and a recent slip history of large earthquakes using LiDAR and optical data in Google Earth. Second, we will use the __[topographic differencing tool](https://opentopography.org/blog/demand-3d-topographic-differencing)__ available on OpenTopography's website to look at a subset of displacements that occurred during the recent 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake in California. \n",

    "## Part 1 - LiDAR Analysis of Wallace Creek, Southern California\n",
    "Wallace Creek (35.271°N -119.827°E) is one of the most famous offset streams in the world, and it is an excellent place to study fault geomorphology. It is located within the Carrizo Plain National Monument, within a segment of the San Andreas fault that is both straight and (relatively) fast moving. We can use this large stream offset, and the smaller offsets of its neighbors, to understand the earthquake history and earthquake potential of this part of the San Andreas.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis we will use a pre-generated KMZ of the LiDAR DEM of Wallace Creek. I have uploaded the DEM to a folder on the shared Google Drive for the course. We will analyze the image in Google Earth. You can either use __[Google Earth on your computer](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro)__, or you can use the __[web-based version](https://earth.google.com/web/)__. \n",

    "### Identifying geomorphic slip indicators on a strike-slip fault\n",
    "To complete this part of the lab, you will need to identify offset features in the LiDAR dataset that indicate slip on the San Andreas Fault. Some things to keep in mind: \n",
    "- This part of the fault is locked, so offsets represent slip during past earthquakes.\n",
    "- Some streams or features might have slipped in multiple past earthquakes, while others in fewer or only one\n",
    "- Your offset estimates need to be self-consistent and have uncertainty estimates associated with them. For example, measure an offset stream from center to center. \n",

Rate is like velocity, so length/time. Use the total_offset_m and total_time_yrs variables and report your answer in mm/yr. "
