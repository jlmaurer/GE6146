I encourage you to take a look at the __[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake)__ description of the event, which describes in detail the aftermath of the event itself and the national and international repercussions in the economy and finance industry of the time. Should such an earthquake happen again today, there would likely be some improvement in damaged buildings, but many of the cities' older buildings and sectors, including gas lines, are still vulnerable. \n",

    "The size of the earthquake is uncertain due to the lack of good observations from that time; however, scientists at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have __[estimated that the earthquake was an MW 7.7 or 7.9](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/magnitude.php)__. \"MW\" stands for \"moment magnitude,\" and is different from the \"Richter magnitude.\" The Richter magnitude scale is no longer used much by scientists because it describes the intensity of shaking, rather than the actual size of the earthquake, and so it can vary a bit depending on site conditions (e.g., soft soils shake harder than bedrock). \n",

The __[**theory of elastic rebound**](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/reid.php)__, which we will use in this lab, is a fundamental idea about how earthquakes work. Why is the theory important? Because it allows us to make predictions of how much slip will happen in the next earthquake.
